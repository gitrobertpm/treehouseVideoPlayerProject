					<!-- 1
					00:00:00,240 ~ 00:00:04,130 -->
					Now that we've looked at the architecture
					of the internet, let's see how you might

					<!-- 2
					00:00:04,130 ~ 00:00:07,535 -->
					connect your personal devices to
					the internet inside your house.
				</p>

				<p id="p2">
					<!-- 3
					00:00:07,535 ~ 00:00:11,270 -->
					<span id="s3">Well there are many ways to
					connect to the internet, and</span>

					<!-- 4
					00:00:11,270 ~ 00:00:13,960 -->
					<span id="s4">most often people connect wirelessly.</span>
				</p>

				<p id="p3">
					<!-- 5
					00:00:13,960 ~ 00:00:17,940 -->
					Let's look at an example of how you can connect to the internet.
				</p>

				<p id="p4">
					<!-- 6
					00:00:17,940 ~ 00:00:22,370 -->
					If you live in a city or a town, you probably have a coaxial cable for

					<!-- 7
					00:00:22,370 ~ 00:00:26,880 -->
					cable Internet, or a phone line if you have DSL, running to the outside of

					<!-- 8
					00:00:26,880 ~ 00:00:30,920 -->
					your house, that connects you to the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.
				</p>

				<p id="p5">
					<!-- 9
					00:00:32,100 ~ 00:00:34,730 -->
					If you live far out in the country, you'll more likely have

					<!-- 10
					00:00:34,730 ~ 00:00:39,430 -->
					a dish outside your house, connecting you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or

					<!-- 11
					00:00:39,430 ~ 00:00:41,190 -->
					you might also use the telephone system.
				</p>

				<p id="p6">
					<!-- 12
					00:00:42,350 ~ 00:00:46,300 -->
					Whether a wire comes straight from the ISP hookup outside your house, or

					<!-- 13
					00:00:46,300 ~ 00:00:49,270 -->
					it travels over radio waves from your roof,

					<!-- 14
					00:00:49,270 ~ 00:00:53,760 -->
					the first stop a wire will make once inside your house, is at your modem.
				</p>

				<p id="p7">
					<!-- 15
					00:00:53,760 ~ 00:00:57,780 -->
					A modem is what connects the internet to your network at home.
				</p>

				<p id="p8">
					<!-- 16
					00:00:57,780 ~ 00:01:00,150 -->
					A few common residential modems are DSL or

					<!-- 17
					00:01:00,150 ~ 00:01:04,085 -->
					cable which translate the digital data from your computer

					<!-- 18
					00:01:04,085 ~ 00:01:09,440 -->
					into digital signals to be transmitted over cable or telephone wires.
				</p>
				
				<p id="p9">
					<!-- 19
					00:01:09,440 ~ 00:01:14,190 -->
					From the modem, an ethernet cable will usually connect to a residential router.
				</p>

				<p id="p10">
					<!-- 20
					00:01:14,190 ~ 00:01:17,600 -->
					Although today, some service providers combine your modem and

					<!-- 21
					00:01:17,600 ~ 00:01:19,150 -->
					router together in one box.
				</p>

				<p id="p11">	
					<!-- 22
					00:01:20,410 ~ 00:01:25,540 -->
					Inside your house, you might have multiple devices from a laptop to a thermostat.
				</p>

				<p id="p12">	
					<!-- 23
					00:01:25,540 ~ 00:01:29,820 -->
					But no matter what kind of devices you have, your router acts as your home's

					<!-- 24
					00:01:29,820 ~ 00:01:32,800 -->
					central hub that connects all you devices to the internet.
				</p>

				<p id="p13">	
					<!-- 25
					00:01:33,850 ~ 00:01:37,530 -->
					In order to connect to a router, you can either hard connect a device with

					<!-- 26
					00:01:37,530 ~ 00:01:42,810 -->
					an ethernet cable, like in the case of a TV, desktop computer, or game console, or

					<!-- 27
					00:01:42,810 ~ 00:01:47,930 -->
					wirelessly, like for a laptop, phone, or printer equipped with Wi-Fi.
				</p>

				<p id="p14">	
					<!-- 28
					00:01:47,930 ~ 00:01:50,110 -->
					To review, everything we've been learning about,

					<!-- 29
					00:01:50,110 ~ 00:01:55,040 -->
					the backbone of the internet is made up of primary routers, networks, and

					<!-- 30
					00:01:55,040 ~ 00:01:59,980 -->
					typically fiber optic cables connecting networks around the globe.
				</p>

				<p id="p15">	
					<!-- 31
					00:01:59,980 ~ 00:02:04,290 -->
					Routers and switches create local and wide area networks.
				</p>

				<p id="p16">
					<!-- 32
					00:02:04,290 ~ 00:02:08,300 -->
					Modems and routers connect your devices to the internet service provider,

					<!-- 33
					00:02:08,300 ~ 00:02:09,878 -->
					which connects you to the internet.
				</p>

				<p id="p17">	
					<!-- 34
					00:02:09,878 ~ 00:02:14,260 -->
					And the TCP/IP protocol suite defines the rules of how

					<!-- 35
					00:02:14,260 ~ 00:02:17,590 -->
					each of these devices communicate over the Internet.
				</p>

				<p id="p18">	
					<!-- 36
					00:02:17,590 ~ 00:02:20,520 -->
					The Internet has come a long way since its inception as

					<!-- 37
					00:02:20,520 ~ 00:02:23,190 -->
					a US Defense Department research project.
				</p>

				<p id="p19">	
					<!-- 38
					00:02:23,190 ~ 00:02:27,290 -->
					And most people take for granted how easy it is to connect information and

					<!-- 39
					00:02:27,290 ~ 00:02:29,740 -->
					people through the Internet nowadays.
				</p>

				<p id="p20">	
					<!-- 40
					00:02:29,740 ~ 00:02:32,230 -->
					But maintaining the pipelines, protocols, and

					<!-- 41
					00:02:32,230 ~ 00:02:36,170 -->
					technologies that keep the Internet working is no easy task.
				</p>

				<p id="p21">	
					<!-- 42 
					00:02:36,170 ~ 00:02:40,120 -->
					It's also important to note before we go, that not everyone in

					<!-- 43
					00:02:40,120 ~ 00:02:44,560 -->
					every country has equal access to this great pipeline of information.
				</p>

				<p id="p22">	
					<!-- 44
					00:02:44,560 ~ 00:02:48,490 -->
					But no matter where you're from, or what you wish to do on the Internet,

					<!-- 45
					00:02:48,490 ~ 00:02:52,950 -->
					being informed, maintaining standards, and contributing to the upkeep of the internet

					<!-- 46
					00:02:52,950 ~ 00:02:56,860 -->
					hardware and protocols is our responsibility as consumers.
