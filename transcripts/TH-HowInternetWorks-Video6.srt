00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,130
Now that we've looked at the architecture
of the internet, let's see how you might

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,535
connect your personal devices to
the internet inside your house.

3
00:00:07,535 --> 00:00:11,270
Well there are many ways to
connect to the internet, and

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,960
most often people connect wirelessly.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,940
Let's look at an example of how
you can connect to the internet.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,370
If you live in a city or a town,
you probably have a coaxial cable for

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,880
cable Internet, or a phone line if you
have DSL, running to the outside of

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,920
your house, that connects you to
the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,730
If you live far out in the country,
you'll more likely have

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,430
a dish outside your house, connecting
you wirelessly to your closest ISP, or

11
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,190
you might also use the telephone system.

12
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,300
Whether a wire comes straight from
the ISP hookup outside your house, or

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,270
it travels over radio
waves from your roof,

14
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,760
the first stop a wire will make once
inside your house, is at your modem.

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,780
A modem is what connects the internet
to your network at home.

16
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,150
A few common residential modems are DSL or

17
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,085
cable which translate the digital
data from your computer

18
00:01:04,085 --> 00:01:09,440
into digital signals to be transmitted
over cable or telephone wires.

19
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,190
From the modem, an ethernet cable will
usually connect to a residential router.

20
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,600
Although today, some service
providers combine your modem and

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,150
router together in one box.

22
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:25,540
Inside your house, you might have multiple
devices from a laptop to a thermostat.

23
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,820
But no matter what kind of devices you
have, your router acts as your home's

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,800
central hub that connects all
you devices to the internet.

25
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,530
In order to connect to a router,
you can either hard connect a device with

26
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,810
an ethernet cable, like in the case of a
TV, desktop computer, or game console, or

27
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,930
wirelessly, like for a laptop, phone,
or printer equipped with Wi-Fi.

28
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,110
To review,
everything we've been learning about,

29
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,040
the backbone of the internet is made
up of primary routers, networks, and

30
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,980
typically fiber optic cables
connecting networks around the globe.

31
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,290
Routers and switches create local and
wide area networks.

32
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,300
Modems and routers connect your devices
to the internet service provider,

33
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,878
which connects you to the internet.

34
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:14,260
And the TCP/IP protocol suite
defines the rules of how

35
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,590
each of these devices
communicate over the Internet.

36
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,520
The Internet has come a long
way since its inception as

37
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,190
a US Defense Department research project.

38
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,290
And most people take for granted how
easy it is to connect information and

39
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,740
people through the Internet nowadays.

40
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,230
But maintaining the pipelines,
protocols, and

41
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,170
technologies that keep the Internet
working is no easy task.

42
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,120
It's also important to note before we go,
that not everyone in

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,560
every country has equal access to
this great pipeline of information.

44
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,490
But no matter where you're from, or
what you wish to do on the Internet,

45
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,950
being informed, maintaining standards, and
contributing to the upkeep of the internet

46
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,860
hardware and protocols is our
responsibility as consumers.
